Project Description:
Buddi is a software developed for managing personal finance and budgeting. The goal of this application is to help people with little or no financial background. It can be run on almost any platform (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and many other operating system) which has java virtual machine installed (Java 1.6 or higher). It can be translated to any languages easily by using its own language editor which allows anyone to edit the translation of the program itself.
Buddi is an open source software developed by Wyatt Olson, released under GNU General Public Licenses, that allows anyone to access, modify, and add/remove features to the source code preferably. Its first release (version 0.9 Beta Release) was in May 2006 and its most current stable release is Buddi-3.4.1.11 which was released in August 2013.
In 2011 Buddi was the winner of About.com Personal Finance Software (Mac) Award, and also it has been nominated for the About.com Reader's Choice Awards.
There are thousands of similar softwares in the market, and most of them are expensive and difficult to understand and maintain. There are some free good tools, as Mint[4], AceMoney[1], MoneyDance[5],YNAB[7] that are listed on a Forbes research about Budgeting Software Options[3], but none of them is an extensible open source project.
All of the above inspires us to choose this software as a part of our project to fulfill the requirements of SOEN 6471/Advanced Software Architecture course.

Introduction
I created Buddi because I wanted a simple to use budgeting software which does not require a degree in accounting to use.  All software which I previously tried to use seemed either too complex or did not have the features which I wanted.
Buddi is my attempt to remedy this problem.  It is written in Java (Java 1.5 required), so it can run on most operating systems.  I have tried to keep it as simple as possible, focusing on the user's budget, and helping the user keep that budget through the use of reports.
Buddi is Open Source software, and is released under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).  For full text of this license, please see the Licenses document.  Basically, this means that you are free to use it, share it, change it, and do just about anything you want with it as long as you keep this notice and keep the derivative works licensed under the GPL as well.
If you like this software, please consider donating via the link on the main Buddi home page (http://buddi.digitalcave.ca).  I develop, support, and maintain Buddi in my spare time, and greatly appreciate all support that I recieve.  Donations have helped me buy new hardware for testing, as well as helping me and my family financially, allowing me to spend more time working on Buddi.

For more information on how to use Buddi to help with your finances, please see the online help documentation, at http://buddi.digitalcave.ca.  This website includes documentation, development and translation resources, pages to track and report bugs and new features requests, and much more.

Cheers!
